# YourAnatomy
See your own anatomy overlayed over live video using Kinect.
This is a Unity project.
I made this initially for a haunted house attraction. I desgned and coded the behavior
and states of the game.
A live video stream is shown with 3D models of a full skeleton and various internal organs
overlayed. I made the models of the skeleton and organs 
and all the shaders and textures.
The Kinect managers and wrappers are third-party, 
most of the files inside YourAnatomy/Assets/KinectScripts are from the Asset store.
I altered the avatar controller.
